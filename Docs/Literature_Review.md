# Literature Review

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting whether a person will buy health insurance. To build a good model, it’s important to understand what previous studies and researchers have already discovered about how people make such decisions.
This section gives a simple overview of what other studies have found about **why people buy (or don’t buy) health insurance**, and how **data and machine learning** can help predict their choices.

## What Past Studies Say
### 1. Why People Buy Health Insurance
Many studies show that people decide to buy health insurance for a few common reasons:
* They want **financial security** and protection against medical costs.
* They feel **influenced by family, friends, or society**.
* They believe that insurance is **useful and necessary**.
* They understand the **benefits and features** of the policy.
* They **trust** the insurance company or have had a **good past experience**.

### 2. What Stops People from Buying
Other studies highlight reasons why some people avoid buying insurance:
* **High premium costs** (too expensive).
* **Low awareness** about how health insurance works.
* **Lack of trust** in insurance companies.
* **Poor customer experience** (like claim delays or rejections).
* Thinking that **they don’t need it** because they are healthy.

### 3. Role of Technology and Online Platforms
Recent research shows that **technology** is also changing how people buy insurance.
When insurance is available online, people care about:
* **Ease of use** (simple website or app).
* **Trust in online platforms**.
* **Good customer support** and quick responses.

### 4. Machine Learning in Insurance
Machine learning is now being used to:
* Predict who is **likely to buy insurance**.
* Predict **insurance costs or premium amounts**.
* Understand **which features (like age, income, or health)** affect decisions the most.
Common algorithms include **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.
These models learn from existing customer data and help insurance companies plan better marketing strategies.

## What’s Missing in Existing Studies
Even though many studies exist, there are still some gaps:
* Most research focuses on **why people buy insurance**, not on **predicting** it using real data.
* Few studies use **machine learning** to explain *why* the model makes certain predictions.
* Most studies are limited to one region or country — more comparison across different areas could help.

## How This Project Fills the Gap
Our project uses real customer data from **Kaggle** and applies **machine learning** to predict whether a person will buy health insurance.
By doing this:
* We can find out which customer details (like age, income, or past insurance) matter the most.
* We can help companies understand their customers better.
* We can show how machine learning can be used for real business decisions.

## Conclusion
In simple terms, past studies show that **money, trust, awareness, and experience** all influence a person’s choice to buy health insurance.
This project builds on that knowledge and uses **data-driven methods** to make smart, accurate predictions about customer behavior.
