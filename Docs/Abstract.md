# Health Insurance Purchase Prediction

## Abstract

**1. Project Title:**
Health Insurance Purchase Prediction

**2. Domain / Technology:**
Healthcare Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Classification Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

**3. Application:**
Assist health insurance companies and agents in identifying high-potential customers who are most likely to purchase health insurance policies.

**4. Dataset (if applicable):**
Customer demographic details such as age, gender, income, education, and occupation; health-related data like medical history, lifestyle habits (smoking, exercise, diet), and family health background; along with previous health insurance purchase records. The dataset may consist of publicly available healthcare insurance data or synthetic data generated by the organization.

**5. Expected Algorithm / Processing:**
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalization), feature selection to identify the most influential attributes affecting health insurance purchase decisions, and model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Model performance will be evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

**6. Expected Output from Project:**
A trained prediction model that classifies customers as “Likely to Purchase” or “Not Interested” in health insurance, along with a ranking mechanism to prioritize leads. The system will also include a dashboard/report to help insurance agents and companies target the right customers, improve marketing efficiency, and boost policy sales.

**7. Abstract in Own Words:**
Health insurance companies often face challenges in identifying potential customers who are genuinely interested in purchasing policies. This leads to inefficient marketing and poor customer targeting. Our project, *Health Insurance Purchase Prediction*, applies machine learning techniques to analyze customer demographic, financial, and health-related factors to predict purchase likelihood. By using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, the model classifies customers into categories such as “Likely to Purchase” or “Not Interested.” The insights generated help agents focus on high-potential customers, optimize outreach strategies, and enhance overall sales performance. This system supports smarter decision-making in the healthcare insurance sector, reducing time and resource waste while increasing profitability.
