## Introduction
This project predicts whether a customer is likely to buy health insurance. It helps insurance companies understand their customers better and offer the right products to the right people.

We use customer data like age, income, family size, health conditions, and previous insurance history to find patterns that indicate who is more likely to purchase insurance. Machine learning turns these patterns into a model that can make predictions for new customers.

## Why This Project?
* Helps insurance companies focus on customers who are likely to buy.
* Provides insights into what factors influence a customer’s decision.
* Makes marketing and customer engagement more effective.
