# Project Planning

## Project Name

**Health Insurance Purchase Prediction**

## Goal

The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to buy health insurance. This will help insurance companies understand their customers better and focus on those who are more likely to purchase.

## What We Will Do

* Analyze customer information like age, income, family size, health conditions, and previous insurance.
* Build a machine learning model to predict purchase behavior.
* Check how accurate the model is.
* Use the model to make predictions for new customers.

## Steps of the Project

### 1. Understand the Problem

* Know what we are trying to predict.
* Decide what customer data is important.

### 2. Collect Data

* Gather customer details.
* Make sure the data is complete and correct.

### 3. Prepare the Data

* Handle missing or wrong values.
* Convert categories like Gender or Occupation into numbers.
* Scale numbers if needed.
* Split the data into training and testing sets.

### 4. Build and Train the Model

* Try different algorithms like:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * Gradient Boosting
* Train the model on the data we have.

### 5. Test and Evaluate

* Check how well the model predicts using:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * ROC-AUC
* Choose the best model.

### 6. Make Predictions

* Use the trained model to predict if new customers will buy insurance.

### 7. Document Everything

* Keep notes about each step.
* Include Introduction, Literature Review, Project Planning, and Results.

## Tools We Will Use

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, XGBoost/LightGBM
* **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
* **Version Control:** GitHub
