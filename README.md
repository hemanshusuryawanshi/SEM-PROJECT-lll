# Health-Insurance-Purchase-Prediction

## Introduction

Our project **Health Insurance Purchase Prediction** is a **machine learning–based system** designed to help health insurance companies identify customers most likely to purchase insurance policies. It analyzes **demographic, financial, and health-related data** such as age, income, lifestyle, and medical history to predict customer purchase intent.

By using predictive analytics, this system assists insurance companies in improving marketing efficiency, optimizing customer outreach, and boosting policy conversion rates. The model produces an output that classifies customers as either **“Likely to Purchase”** or **“Not Interested.”** Additionally, it can rank potential customers to help prioritize sales efforts.

**Machine Learning Algorithms Used:**

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

**Output:**

* Predicts purchase likelihood (Yes/No)
* Ranks leads to improve sales efficiency
